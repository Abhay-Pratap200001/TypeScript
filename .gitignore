# Compilation Artifacts
# Compiled JavaScript files and source maps are typically generated in a build directory
# and should not be committed to source control. The default output directory is often 'dist' or 'build'.
# Adjust these paths as necessary to match your project's tsconfig.json 'outDir'.
/dist
/build
*.js.map
*.d.ts.map

# If you are compiling TypeScript files to the same directory as your source
# files, use a more specific pattern to ignore *only* the generated files,
# while still tracking the source files.
# Example: ignore all .js files, but do *not* ignore .js files that start with an underscore (if you have any manual js files)
# *.js
# !_*js

# Logs and temporary files
npm-debug.log*
yarn-debug.log*
yarn-error.log*

*.log
.grunt

# Environment variables

!.env.example # Track an example file to show which variables are needed
